# Workshop Email Template and Sample Code for Live Workshops
## Overview
This code base contains the core email code to share key links for workshops in a slick email friendly ui. When reading this code you could 
flash back to 1999 with the old school <table> structures. But keep in mind email html clients are legacy pieces of junk in many cases. 

- Please note that the core .psd with image elements will need to be modified for each workshop, and the file is in the /images directory.
